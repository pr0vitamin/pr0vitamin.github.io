Ok, so maybe that's a tad melodramatic, but bear with me ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ.

You may notice that there's a banner on my site now, about this "net neutrality" thing.
I'm not normally one to push my personal beliefs onto other people, but this is just <b>so</b> important that you need to know about it (although hopefully you're already aware of it).

Today is Internet Slowdown Day. Lots of big sites like Reddit, Upworthy, and Pornhub are purposely slowing down their content (or at least giving the illusion of doing so), in protest of the FCC's propositions against net neutrality. Why would they do this to themselves? Well, what the FCC is proposing is kind of a big deal, and it effects all of us: content providers and consumers.

Net neutrality is the idea that all the traffic that passes over the internet should be treated equally. This is good, and an integral part of the internet as we know it.
It doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, or how much money you have, your traffic on the internet is treated the same as anyone elses. Neat, huh?

This idea has recently been threatened, when the FCC released some "proposed regulatory guidelines", back in May.
These guidelines suggest the creation of a "fast-lane" and an "even faster lane" for internet traffic, so that companies can pay money to serve content to their users faster.
Hey, I'm all for faster content, but the two-tiered approach is concerning. Why? It goes against the freedom and creativity that made the internet into what it is today.
The FCC can try and spin a phrase to make it sound positive, but the fact of the matter is: If you have a fast lane, you also have a slow lane.
The FCC wants to stick everyone into the slow lane, and create a type of "pay-to-play" system so the big players can get into the fast lane.
This inhibits innovation and competition, by creating a pay-wall, making it hard for new companies to get off the ground.

John Oliver recently ran a comedy segment on net neutrality, if you haven't already seen it, it's well worth a watch.
Sure it's a comedy segment, but he touches on some very real, and very important issues.

The FCC is still allowing comments from the public about their proposed changes to net neutrality, but only until <b>September the 15th</b>.
If you don't agree with what they're doing, please take the time to let them know by either clicking on the banner, or going to:

The internet thanks you.
