_The Ganache does beautifully as a donut glaze, among other things!_

It's white chocolate, but not as you know it.

By caramelising white chocolate slowly in the oven, the regular single-note sweetness of white chocolate takes on some complex caramel and nutty flavours.
But we're not stopping there. Add just a little bit of white Miso to that bad boy and you've got a one-way ticket to flavourtownÂ¹.
The Miso adds a subtle savoury/salty note that completely elevates the chocolate, and will blow people's minds.

You like salted caramel? Well this is salted caramel's older & sexier brother.
Enough chit-chat, here's how to make it.

# Caramelised White Chocolate & Miso Ganache

Makes a little over a cup (~300ml)

### Ingredients
* 250g White Chocolate (Try and find some with at least 28% cocoa butter)
* 1 Tbsp Coconut Oil (Only needed if you can't find a high cocoa butter white chocolate)
* 1 Tbsp White/Shiro Miso Paste (Check your local asian grocer)
* 1 Tbsp Butter
* 1/3 cup (80g) Cream (Or more if you want to make a sauce rather than a ganache)

### Method
1. Preheat oven to 120C.
2. Break up the white chocolate into small pieces, and place in a single layer on a small baking tray. Add the coconut oil now if you're using a low cocoa butter chocolate.
3. Put the chocolate in the oven.
4. Check on the chocolate every 10 minutes and give it a stir with a dry spatula. It should start slowly changing colour after about 20 minutes.
5. If at any stage the chocolate looks too dry and starts seizing up, add a very small amount of coconut oil and stir it in. This should make the chocolate more liquid again.
6. Cook for around 40 minutes, until it's looking a golden-brown colour. You can even go up to 60 minutes if you want a deeper caramel flavour.
7. Transfer to a bowl, and use a whisk to stir in the miso paste, followed by the butter.
8. While whisking, slowly pour in the cream. Continue whisking until a smooth and shiny ganache has formed.

At this point you can use it for anything you'd normally do with a ganache for: Chocolate fillings, donut/cake icings, eating with a spoon... Or if you want something more like a sauce, just keep whisking and adding cream until you reach the desired consistency.

1. Flavortown is not a real place, sorry.
