We don't celebrate Thanksgiving here in New Zealand, but I'll be damned if that means I have to miss out on the food!

Since last year we started celebrating TomHanksGiving, which is basically just an excuse to get together with some friends, have a few drinks, some laughs, and indulge in some American Thanksgiving classics.

Here's some of the food highlights from TomHanksGiving 2017:

_With the dark meat I did a roulade, cooked sous vide, and finished in the deep frier_
