I make games occasionally, most of them don't make it off my computer. Here's a few that have!

<h2>Lion Heart</h2>

This game was made in 48 hours for the 2014 Global Game Jam. We decided to pick up a javascript rendering engine that none of us had used before, <a href="https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/">pixi.js</a>, and learn it as we went. Our artist had never done digital art for a video game before, and primarily paints, which I think has given the game quite a nice visual style.
