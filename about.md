So yeah, as you may have already guessed, my name is Jeremy.

I love food. Seriously. I LOVE the stuff.

When I'm not either cooking or eating, I'm making games, websites, inappropriate jokes, riding motorcycles, drinking fancy beer and whisky, or posting pictures of food and/or cats on instagram.

Feel free to contact me. Or don't. Whatever. I don't care.
