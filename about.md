title: About

When I'm not either cooking or eating, I'm making games, websites, inappropriate jokes, riding motorcycles, doing random software/hardware projects, drinking, or posting pictures of food and/or cats on instagram.

I like curing and smoking delicious meats. I'll probably make a blog about that at some point.

Feel free to contact me. Or don't. Whatever.
